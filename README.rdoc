== Server for CocktailDepot

Currently in development.

Server is pretty simple. Based on Ruby On Rails, it returns JSON-formatted text as response for specified requests (see in `config/routes.rb` file, of course).
Android application needs to parse JSON and show content.

== Used third-party gems:

* Rails Admin (https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin)
* Paperclip (https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)
* OmniAuth (https://github.com/intridea/omniauth)
